3. They say I’m like [Hummingbird](https://images.app.goo.gl/vVdoMivX3v7GaSv58) (small, quick and bright). I’m quick to learn, small enough but with a big potential, and bright as I can make everything look better.
4. My main skill is to constantly lurk for smth new and challenging.

if ( int == 1 || int == 2 || int == 12 )
                {alert("Зима");}
            else if ( 3 <= int && int <= 5 )
                {alert("Весна");}
            else if ( 6 <= int && int <= 8 )
                {alert("Лето");}
